This is a Memory based project, developed to help elderly people improve their memory and cognitive abilities. At the older age, the remembering capacity gets weaken, to maintain the cognitive abilities or furthermore improve it for having a better health, games based on memory can be played.

This is a MEMORY-MATCH-GAME called Magic Match:

In this there are 12 cards, every two cards has same picture on it, all are kept upside down. The player can flip two cards to see the image underneath, if they are matched, they stay flipped, if they don't, they turn over again, memory plays an important factor to complete this game in minimum possible turns (Turn count is also displayed at the bottom), as when a player remembers the card position, it is most likely to open it when he found the other card of the pair. This triggers the coginitive functioning of the memory which is essential for healthy mind for elderly people.

If player want to start the game all over again, he/she can click on New Game, all the cards are again shuffled and game can again be played from start which new positions of the card.

What Else can Be Done:
This is a single player game, further we can take a step up, so that two players can play it and also series of the game can be recorded as the record, even highlighting, BEST SCORE so far, so that people can find it more engaging and more brainstorming can be done.
